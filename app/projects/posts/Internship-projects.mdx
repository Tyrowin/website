## Subproject 1:

Automatic collection of values from water meters in 60 different properties in the Malm√∂ region for storage on the Microsoft Azure platform.
Programming was done in Python. Data sorting into folders based on day, month and year. Azure Key Vault is also used for API key management and authentication, etc.

This solution is now used by SFAB in a production environment.

## Subproject 2:

Automation of the provisioning process of newly installed sensors in the network for e.g. reading of water, electricity and energy.
The application continuously listens for messages from SFAB's asset register. The system, which runs via Azure, supports the installers out in the field. When a new sensor is reported as installed, the system provisions the sensor in the network. Programming was done in Python.

This solution is now used by SFAB in a production environment.

## Subproject 3:

Development and test installation of a system for decoding messages from water meters.
The aim was to test a model for future IMD measurement.
Programming was done in Python. The script takes in messages from the meters in the form of a 92-character long string which is then decoded.
This solution is used by Stena Group IT in a production environment.

## Sub-project 4:

Development of application, with graphical interface, in order to verify that correct data can be retrieved from specific supplier of water, electricity and energy meters.
The application is developed in Python and then compiled into an .exe file to facilitate direct use without programming knowledge.

## Subproject 5:

Development of a geocoding system for SFAB's properties around Sweden, including map generation that visualizes the properties' respective geographic position.
Programming was done in Python where geocoding was done with Nominatim.

The solution is now part of SFAB's internal web, where their network provider gets an overview of all SFAB's properties.

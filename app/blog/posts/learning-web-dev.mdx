### Diving into web development

Recently I started learning web development. It's been a fun journey so far. I've learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excited to learn more about React and Next.js.
Using codecademy and freecodecamp has been really helpful, and has been a great way to complement my learning experience.

### Building my first website

This is it! (where you are now) using a vercel template?? ***lazy***

"yes yes i know but whatever its fun."

I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. I'm looking forward to building more projects and learning new things.

### Conclusion

Learning something new is challenging, but fun at the same time. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. I can't wait to see what the future holds. 

"i hope to be able to build a website from scratch soon, but for now this is a good start."
